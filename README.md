# Cardiovascular Disease Detection using ML Techniques

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to detect cardiovascular diseases in individuals. The analysis is performed on Kaggle's Heart Failure Prediction dataset, incorporating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the effects of various attributes and correlation patterns influencing cardiovascular diseases.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Heart Failure Prediction dataset, containing a comprehensive set of attributes related to cardiovascular health.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset, exploring the relationships between different attributes and their impact on cardiovascular diseases.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The project deploys the following machine learning algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Employed for classification tasks, Logistic Regression is used to estimate the probabilities of binary outcomes, such as the presence or absence of cardiovascular diseases, based on a set of independent variables.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
   - Utilized for classification tasks, KNN identifies patterns in the dataset based on the proximity of data points, helping to classify individuals based on the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases among their nearest neighbors.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - SVM is applied for classification, aiming to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data points into two categories: individuals with and without cardiovascular diseases, thus facilitating accurate predictions.

4. **XGBoost:**
   - XGBoost stands out for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling complex datasets, making it highly suitable for predicting cardiovascular disease outcomes by leveraging gradient boosting techniques for enhanced prediction accuracy.


## Results

- The ML algorithms are evaluated, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of all models in predicting cardiovascular diseases in the dataset.
